## Overview of our Analysis
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. As the number of COVID-19 infections and deaths worldwide continues to increase rapidly, the prevention and control of COVID-19 remains urgent. This article aims to analyze COVID-19 from a geographical perspective, and this information can provide useful insights for rapid visualization of spatial-temporal epidemic information and identification of the factors important to the spread of COVID-19. This project is analyzing North Calorina state covid by total number of cases, hospitalizations, death and quarantine.
